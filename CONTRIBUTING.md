# Setting up Your Environment

Here's how to get your environment setup.  You will need Git and NPM installed on your system.

Clone down the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ThePacielloGroup/CCAe.git
```

Install Dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Install Dev Dependencies:

```
npm install --only=dev
```

Run the application:

```
npm run start
```

To build a new version:

```shell
  # Because some libraries need to be compiled natively, you can build only for your current OS.
  # i.e. you can't build a Windows version if you are under MacOS

  # build a version for the current platform
  npm run dist
```

The CHANGELOG.md is generated using github-changelog-generator
https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator

```shell
github_changelog_generator -u ThePacielloGroup -p CCAe --since-tag=v1.1.2 --future-release=v1.2.0
```

Other commands are available in the `package.json` file.
